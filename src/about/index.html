                NLP Labs, LLC (DBA NLP, LLC) believes that the power of natural language
                processing (NLP) should be accessible to anyone. Too much of human
                knowledge is expressed in natural languages, from The Analects to The
                Bible, from Beowulf to social media posts. Whether someone can code should
                not become a burden to tap into the vast amount of knowledge in text. We
                want to empower anyone to do NLP without knowing coding nor positional
                encoding in Google's BERT. The new NLP experience should be very much like
                doing regression analyses in Microsoft Excel. We are the Excel for text!
